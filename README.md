Simple-Responsive-Design-Demontration
=====================================

a taste of responsive scripts

See it in action
----------------
A link to gh-pages will be added soon (I have to make the branch and sync, blabla, I'll do it soon)

Usage
-----

Simply download, extract and open index file in a web browser. Ultimatly, you could use a web server, but that's useless for the actual ressources ;)

Read the code and see how easy it is to make a responsive design with those tools!
