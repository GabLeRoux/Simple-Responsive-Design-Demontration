See it in action
----------------

A link to gh-pages will be added soon (I have to make the branch and sync, blabla, I'll do it soon)

Usage
-----

Simply download, extract and open index file in a web browser. Ultimatly, you could use a web server, but that's useless for the actual ressources ;)

Read the code and see how easy it is to make a responsive design with those tools!

Todo
----
* Add more scripts and cool tricks with jQuery-ui
* Add lavalamp menu navigation (files already there)
* Add list of used scripts in this readme for quick access
